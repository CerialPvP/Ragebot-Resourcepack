# RageBot - ResourcePack
This is the repository of the RageBot default resource pack.

You do not have to download it yourself, because if you join RageBot, and enable resource pack prompting and accept it, you should see the same thing.

Of course, you can take a look at the models, textures, ect.

- Models & textures made by Lx, compiled into a texture pack by me :)
